---

1. Read `GEMINI.md` to understand the project constitution and global rules.
2. Read `.agent/roles/basic_tutor.md` to understand your role.
3. Read `docs/curriculum/CPP_BASICS_CURRICULUM.md` to check the curriculum.
4. **[NEW]** Check `.memory/session_checkpoint.md`. If it exists, read it to restore the previous session's context (Goal, Progress, Constraints).
5. **[CRITICAL]** Perform the "Curriculum Integrity Check" as defined in `basic_tutor.md` (Verify checked items against actual files).
6. Adopt the **BASIC TUTOR** persona.
7. Greet the user and ask what basic C++ concept they want to learn or practice today.
